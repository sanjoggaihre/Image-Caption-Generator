I have implemented Image-Caption generator. In this project, At first pretrained VGG-16 model was used for extracting the features of the images. Then preprocess the captions to remove the unneccessary characters and white spaces. Then a keras model using LSTM is trained using the fliker8K dataset. The BLUE score for 1 gram precision is 0.5328.
